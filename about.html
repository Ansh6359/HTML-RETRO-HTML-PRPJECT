        <p>The Macintosh (often called "the Mac") was the first widely-sold personal computer with a graphical user
            interface (GUI) and a mouse. Apple Computer introduced the Macintosh in an ad during Super Bowl XVIII, on
            January 22, 1984, and offered it for sale two days later.</p>
        <p>The Mac was designed to provide users with a natural, intuitively understandable, and, in general,
            "user-friendly" computer interface. Many of the user interface ideas in the Macintosh derived from
            experiments
            at the Xerox Parc laboratory in the early 1970s, including the mouse, the use of icons to represent objects
            or
            actions, the point-and-click and click-and-drag actions, and a number of window operation ideas. Microsoft
            successfully adapted these user interface concepts for its first Windows operating system.</p>

            <h3>How get we started in 1976</h3>
            <p>How did Apple get started?
                Apple Computer, Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who
                brought to the new company a vision of changing the way people viewed computers. Jobs and Wozniak wanted
                to
                make computers small enough for people to have them in their homes or offices.</p>
            <p>Jobs and Wozniak started out building the Apple I in Jobs' garage and sold them without a monitor,
                keyboard,
                or casing (which they decided to add on in 1977). The Apple II revolutionized the computer industry with
                the
                introduction of the first-ever color graphics. Sales jumped from $7.8 million in 1978 to $117 million in
                1980, the year Apple went public.2

                Wozniak left Apple in 1983 due to a diminishing interest in the day-to-day running of Apple Computer.
                Jobs
                then hired PepsiCo's John Sculley to be president. However, this move backfired and after much
                controversy
                with Sculley, Jobs left in 1985 and went on to new and bigger things. He founded his own company NeXT
                Software and he also bought Pixar from George Lucas, which would later become a huge success in computer
                animation of such movies as Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc., and Finding Nemo.

                Through the rest of the 1980s, Apple was still doing well and in 1990 it posted its highest profits yet.
                This was, however, mostly due to the plans that Jobs had already set in motion before he left, most
                notably
                his deal with a tiny company by the name of Adobe, creator of the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF).
                Together the two companies created the phenomenon known as desktop publishing.4</p>
