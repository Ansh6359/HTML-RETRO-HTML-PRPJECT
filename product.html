            <p>Macintosh 128K—is the original Apple Macintosh personal computer. It played a pivotal role in
                establishing
                desktop publishing as a general office function. The motherboard, a 9 in (23 cm) CRT monitor, and a
                floppy
                drive were housed in a beige case with integrated carrying handle; it came with a keyboard and
                single-button
                mouse. It sold for US$2,495 (equivalent to $6,500 in 2021). The Macintosh was introduced by a television
                commercial entitled "1984" shown during Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984[6] and directed by Ridley
                Scott. Sales of the Macintosh were strong from its initial release on January 24, 1984, and reached
                70,000
                units on May 3, 1984.[7] Upon the release of its successor, the Macintosh 512K, it was rebranded as the
                Macintosh 128K. The computer's model number was M0001</p>

            <h3>First Gen of Apple III</h3>
            <!--Here I have put some discription of product-->
            <p>The Apple III (styled as apple ///) is a business-oriented personal computer produced by Apple Computer
                and
                released in 1980. Running the Apple SOS operating system, it was intended as the successor to the Apple
                II
                series, but was largely considered a failure in the market. It was designed to provide key features
                business
                users wanted in a personal computer: a true typewriter-style upper/lowercase keyboard (the Apple II only
                supported uppercase) and an 80-column display.

                Work on the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Dr. Wendell Sander. It had the internal
                code name of "Sara", named after Sander's daughter.[3] The system was announced on May 19, 1980 and
                released
                in late November that year.[1] Serious stability issues required a design overhaul and a recall of the
                first
                14,000 machines produced. The Apple III was formally reintroduced on November 9, 1981.</p>

            <!--Here I have put some discription of product-->
            <p>AApple manufactured Monitor //, which as the name implies, was more suited in look and style for the
                Apple II
                line and at the same time added improvements in features and visual quality. In 1984 a miniature 9″
                screen,
                called the Monitor IIc, was introduced for the Apple IIc computer to help complement its compact size.
                This
                display was also the first to use the brand new design language for Apple's products called Snow White,
                as
                well as being the first display not in a beige color, but rather a bright, creamy off-white. By early
                1985
                came the first color CRTs, starting with the Monitor 100, a digital RGB display for the Apple III and
                Apple
                IIe (with appropriate card), followed shortly by the 14″ ColorMonitor IIe (later renamed to AppleColor
                Composite Monitor IIe) and ColorMonitor IIc (later renamed to AppleColor Composite Monitor IIc),
                composite
                video displays for those respective models. All of these Apple displays support the maximum Apple II
                Double
                Hi-Res standard of 560×192.</p>

            <p>The Apple II used a MOS 6502 chip for its central processing unit. It came with 4 KB RAM, but could be
                extended up to 48 KB RAM. It included a BASIC interpreter and could support graphics and a color
                monitor.
                External storage was originally on cassette tape, but later Apple introduced an external floppy disk
                drive.

            <p>The first commercial typewriters were introduced in 1874,[2] but did not become common in offices until
                after
                the mid-1880s.[3][where?] The typewriter quickly became an indispensable tool for practically all
                writing
                other than personal handwritten correspondence. It was widely used by professional writers, in offices,
                business correspondence in private homes, and by students preparing written assignments.</p>
